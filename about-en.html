            <h3>Immunotherapy with dendritic cells</h3>
            <p>The immune system helps people stay healthy by recognizing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, as
              well as cancer cells, as harmful and killing them. It has been known for some time that the so-called
              antigen-presenting cells are necessary for the recognition of foreign bodies (antigens). These
              antigen-presenting cells inform the immune system of the invasion and activate other immune cells to fight
              it in a variety of ways.</p>

            <h3>Treatment process</h3>
            <p>
              Before starting therapy, an updated serology of infection for HIV, hepatitis B and C must be performed.
              Even if the infection status is known, we are obliged to retest it shortly before starting therapy in a
              certified laboratory, which has been reported to our regulatory authorities for reasons of product safety
              and occupational safety ...<br>

              After obtaining monocytes, they are cultured in the laboratory according to various protocols and
              differentiated into dendritic cells or tolerogenic or regenerating macrophages. Depending on the protocol,
              patients receive their "trained" cells back in 4-7 days.<br>

              Treatment is usually given as a baseline immunization three times, one day apart, for one week.<br> </p>

            <h3>Rehabilitation after cancer</h3>
            <p>Cancer rehabilitation is aimed at Patients who have completed primary cancer treatment and who wish to
              improve their physical and mental health.
              Each victim responds differently to the cancer problem and its treatment. Thus, in a holistic and
              interdisciplinary approach, treatment goals are jointly defined in order to gain new strength to return to
              professional and personal daily life. </p>
