            <b>Gulmira Mamedova </b>- Psychologist. In 1997 she graduated from the Almaty Medical University in
            Kazakhstan.
            In 2002, Gulmira moved to the United Kingdom, where she studied journalism, and then became an international
            volunteer who dedicated her travels to working with children and adults with vulnerable health.
            In 2016, Gulmira was enrolled in Marisa Pir's school to study Rapid Transformational Therapy.
            In 2017, she received her Certificate in Clinical Hypnotherapy after 400 hours of continuous professional
            development. Since then, Gulmira has been part of the successful Find A Therapist Service, providing
            high-quality Rapid Transformational Therapy sessions addressing issues such as anxiety, fear, confidence,
            weight control (including bulimia, anorexia, autorexia), cancer and autoimmune diseases.
            Gulmira's father was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1995. After stomach amputation without chemotherapy
            and radiation therapy, her dad's condition has become more stable and the disease has been in remission for
            almost 20 years. Through regular review of his dietary requirements and the provision of natural
            supplements, her father's health improved significantly. Psychological balance was achieved through
            prayer-meditations and physical exercises. Gulmira has watched her father's health all these years, learning
            more and more about the psychosomatic connection between the brain and cancer.
            Dad's personal story inspired Gulmira to apply for a Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner at the
            Institute of Functional Medicine to learn how chronic diseases are treated with healthy eating, natural
            supplements and stress management techniques under the supervision of a specialist.

            <h3>Immunotherapy with dendritic cells</h3>
            <p>The immune system helps people stay healthy by recognizing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, as
              well as cancer cells, as harmful and killing them. It has been known for some time that the so-called
              antigen-presenting cells are necessary for the recognition of foreign bodies (antigens). These
              antigen-presenting cells inform the immune system of the invasion and activate other immune cells to fight
              it in a variety of ways.</p>

            <h3>Treatment process</h3>
            <p>
              Before starting therapy, an updated serology of infection for HIV, hepatitis B and C must be performed.
              Even if the infection status is known, we are obliged to retest it shortly before starting therapy in a
              certified laboratory, which has been reported to our regulatory authorities for reasons of product safety
              and occupational safety ...<br>

              After obtaining monocytes, they are cultured in the laboratory according to various protocols and
              differentiated into dendritic cells or tolerogenic or regenerating macrophages. Depending on the protocol,
              patients receive their "trained" cells back in 4-7 days.<br>

              Treatment is usually given as a baseline immunization three times, one day apart, for one week.<br> </p>

            <h3>Rehabilitation after cancer</h3>
            <p>Cancer rehabilitation is aimed at Patients who have completed primary cancer treatment and who wish to
              improve their physical and mental health.
              Each victim responds differently to the cancer problem and its treatment. Thus, in a holistic and
              interdisciplinary approach, treatment goals are jointly defined in order to gain new strength to return to
              professional and personal daily life. </p>
