        <h2>Rehabilitation after cancer</h2>
        <p>

          <span class="text__roboto">
            Cancer rehabilitation is aimed at Patients who have completed primary cancer treatment and who wish to
            improve their physical and mental health.
            Each victim responds differently to the cancer problem and its treatment. Thus, in a holistic and
            interdisciplinary approach, treatment goals are jointly defined in order to gain new strength to return to
            professional and personal daily life. Cancer rehabilitation offers a wide range of therapeutic and
            diagnostic measures. The focus is on therapeutic exercise therapy / sports, sensorimotor skills (especially
            for patients with severe symptoms of polyneuropathy) and psychosocial support.
            <br><br>

          <img src="img/reha.jpg" alt="" width="100%"> <br>
          <b style="font-size: 20px;">Physiotherapy</b><br><br>


          The exercise program for the patient is carried out by physiotherapists with various additional
          qualifications: <br>

          Remedial gymnastics: under guidance, weakened muscles are strengthened and mobility is improved. The patterns
          of physiological movements are again worked out, training of the cardiovascular system, as well as the
          coordinating and mobilization aspects, are included. This whole body workout uses a variety of aids such as
          balls, sticks or tera bands.<br><br>
          Strength Training: Different machines use different exercises to build muscle. This means that physical
          complaints can also be avoided as a preventive measure. Besides building muscle, strength and endurance are
          also increased.<br><br>
          Endurance training: Bicycle ergometer exercises and Nordic walking allow you to consistently train your
          endurance.
          Coordination training: Various coordination skills (e.g. balance, orientation, rhythm, responsiveness) are
          trained with or without assisting devices (balls, MFT disc, BalancePad, etc.)<br><br><br>

          <b style="font-size: 20px;">Ergotherapy</b><br><br>
          During cancer rehabilitation, occupational therapy focuses on the patient's daily activities. In order to do
          this satisfactorily in daily life, different abilities and skills are required. It is on these abilities and
          skills that occupational therapy is focused. Exercise and activity purposefully promote well-being and
          health.<br><br>

          Individual therapy: With a help of special methods (for example, fine motor training, sensitivity training,
          cognitive training, ergonomic recommendations for the workplace), individual goals that are relevant to
          everyday life are achieved.<br><br>
          Therapy Seminar: With a targeted proposition in which “being active” and “having fun” are at the forefront,
          new positive experiences can be gained at all levels.<br><br><br>

          <b style="font-size: 20px;">Clinical psychology and health psychology</b><br><br>
          Counseling / Treatment: Psychological conversations have a calming effect and help you find a personal way to
          deal with cancer and your current life situation. In one-on-one psychological conversation, time and space is
          provided for those the patient is currently dealing with or would like to deal with. These topics of
          conversation may include planning health behavior, strengthening individual resources, coping with illness,
          personal, family, or professional crises.<br><br>
          Psychological training: During the training, psychological knowledge about health is transmitted, which helps
          to cope with cancer and associated stressors.
          We use hypnotherapy by Marisa Pier. “The mind believes what you tell it. Every thought provokes a physical
          reaction in the body ... ”. Marisa Peer, founder of Rapid Transformational Therapy (RTT) claims. "Your
          imagination is the most powerful tool you wield, and your mind has the most powerful healing potential on the
          planet."<br><br>
          Marisa Pir has overcome cancer and testifies that mental strength was the key to her quick recovery. In one of
          her books, Marisa shares her story of how "it is helpful for cancer patients to visualize tumor shrinkage and
          imagine how the body is shutting off the blood supply to the cancer." This comes from her personal experience
          as well as from her practice. When she shared her own experience of diagnosing cancer, she actively imagined
          how cancer fades and shrinks. Marisa Peer surprised doctors with how quickly she made a full recovery and is
          now teaching patients how to use cell therapy, the healing vortex and other aspects of Rapid Transformational
          Therapy ™ (RTT) to achieve life-changing results.<br><br><br>

          <b style="font-size: 20px;">Diet recommendations</b><br><br>
          During the course of cancer and its treatment, changes in nutritional requirements can be observed. In
          oncological rehabilitation, specific therapeutic nutritional measures are discussed and agreed upon one-on-one
          with a nutritionist.<br><br><br>

          <b style="font-size: 20px;">Therapeutic massage / special massage</b><br><br>
          Therapeutic massage completes the rehabilitation program by relaxing muscles and affecting circulation, but
          also stimulating mobility and agility. If indicated, you can also use special types of massage, such as manual
          lymphatic drainage, massage of the reflex zone (feet) or massage of the connective tissue.<br><br><br>

          <b style="font-size: 20px;">Yoga</b><br><br>
          Studies have been conducted by the US State Cancer Institute (NCI) on the effects of yoga on women with breast
          cancer. Sixty patients diagnosed with breast cancer took part in the first stage of the research. Half of them
          did yoga regularly for two months, the other half of the women did not receive any additional stress.
          The research results showed that women who practiced yoga improved their health, increased activity, increased
          energy and a complete absence of depressive moods. The second stage of the experiment was repeated with the
          participation of one hundred and twenty women, half of them did yoga, and the second did not. The results were
          confirmed, except that these studies showed that women in the first group who practiced yoga were physically
          stronger and better tolerated the side effects of treatment. Yoga for breast cancer helps patients fight the
          consequences of cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, postoperative problems). - Increases tone and
          relieves drowsiness, gives strength to further fight the disease. - Breathing practices help to cope with
          nausea and dizziness, give calmness and confidence. If you practice yoga even for a short time, it still gives
          a tangible effect. Classes combine meditation, postures (asanas) and breathing practices (pranayamas).
          Meditation is extremely important for people with cancer. This disease is hard on the body and, in fact, is a
          stress that hits a woman's immunity. By meditating for at least twenty minutes a day, you can achieve that
          stress will not remain and the immune system will be protected. Good immunity is the key to recovery.Ayuverda
          - as an accompanying cancer therapy When the immune system needs support. "It secretly grew in me", "I just
          felt a little weak", "I'm afraid for my life." Cancer patients experience their threatening condition in this
          or something similar. About 1,000 degenerated cells develop in healthy people every day. In cancer patients,
          however, the body's own defenses were unable to expose them and render them harmless with the help of immune
          cells. Instead, cancer cells proliferate uncontrollably and can gradually destroy vital tissues.
          In addition, cancer cells can spread further to nearby lymph nodes or organs and continue to grow
          there.<br><br><br>

          <b style="font-size: 20px;">How does Vedic medicine relate to cancer?</b><br><br>
          According to Maharishi Ayurveda, cancer begins with a loss of natural balance. Due to our lifestyle, metabolic
          residues and toxins called Ama in Ayurveda are constantly generated, which in the case of cancer, especially
          accumulate at a certain point in the body. At the same time, the human immune system usually declines over the
          years as a result of malnutrition and malnutrition, as well as environmental toxins; almost always combined
          with emotional stress.
          However, according to Ayurveda, no two patients are alike and therefore all cancers are different. The
          Ayurvedic approach in our clinic is based on a holistic approach. More and more patients are finding that
          conventional treatments alone are not enough. They understand that the path to recovery must be at all levels.
          In the case of cancer, especially, many factors must be taken into account simultaneously in order to give a
          new impetus to the body's own defense. The systematic elimination of toxins, the supply of vital substances
          through a high-quality diet and herbal preparations, especially for breaking down tumor cells, is just as
          important as balancing the nervous system - all especially for you. It is important to bring the natural
          regulatory principles into the necessary balance. So that your natural self-healing abilities will prevail
          again.<br><br><br>

          <b style="font-size: 20px;">Tibetan Singing Bowl Therapy</b><br><br>
          The first bowls made of metal alloy began to be used in the Far East 6,000 years ago. Tibetan Singing Bowls
          are a mysterious sound phenomenon discovered by "spiritual tourists" in the Himalayas. After the Chinese
          invasion of Tibet, bowls also appeared in Europe and the United States.<br><br>

          The sound of the Tibetan bowls and gong harmonizes and relaxes the left and right sides of the brain. Sound
          relieves tension at all levels and detoxifies the body. Feelings subside after leaving, the reason becomes
          clear. Sound vibrations have a positive effect on the body long after the end of the swing.
          Sound therapy is one of the fastest and most effective ways to restore harmony and relaxation. All music has
          therapeutic effects, but the gong has the strongest energy. Sound has been used for thousands of years as a
          means of awakening deep states of consciousness, expanding consciousness and eliminating energy imbalances.
          The ancient Chinese therapy with vibrating gong sounds has recently become available to us.

            <h3>Immunotherapy with dendritic cells</h3>
            <p>The immune system helps people stay healthy by recognizing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, as
              well as cancer cells, as harmful and killing them. It has been known for some time that the so-called
              antigen-presenting cells are necessary for the recognition of foreign bodies (antigens). These
              antigen-presenting cells inform the immune system of the invasion and activate other immune cells to fight
              it in a variety of ways.</p>

            <h3>Treatment process</h3>
            <p>
              Before starting therapy, an updated serology of infection for HIV, hepatitis B and C must be performed.
              Even if the infection status is known, we are obliged to retest it shortly before starting therapy in a
              certified laboratory, which has been reported to our regulatory authorities for reasons of product safety
              and occupational safety ...<br>

              After obtaining monocytes, they are cultured in the laboratory according to various protocols and
              differentiated into dendritic cells or tolerogenic or regenerating macrophages. Depending on the protocol,
              patients receive their "trained" cells back in 4-7 days.<br>

              Treatment is usually given as a baseline immunization three times, one day apart, for one week.<br> </p>
