        <h2>Frequently asked Questions
        </h2><br>
        <p>
          <b>Why hasn't my healthcare professional recommended immunotherapy for me?</b><br><br>

          Even experts find it difficult to keep track of all current events. Besides, traditional medicine is, let's
          say, very traditional. New therapeutic approaches usually take decades before they are recognized and
          generally available. <br> <br>

          This is especially true when implementing a fundamentally new idea. With conventional procedures, the doctor
          tries to "beat cancer" with chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation. On the other hand, with immunotherapy, the
          patient must be able to resist the disease using his own immune system. <br> <br>

          Immuno-oncology is a very young science that is constantly generating new knowledge. Therefore, physicians
          should always update their specialized information. This makes high demands, but makes it possible to better
          and better adapt the therapy to the individual situation of the patient and his tumor. <br> <br>

          <b>What are the advantages of immunotherapy over chemotherapy or radiation therapy?</b><br><br>

          Chemotherapy and radiation therapy damage cells that divide rapidly but are ineffective against dormant tumor
          stem cells. Therefore, a direct therapeutic effect can only be expected at the time of application: If, for
          example, hair grows back after the end of chemotherapy, tumor cells can also grow back. In contrast, dendritic
          cell immunotherapy can lead to the formation of "immune memory" that provides longer lasting protection, such
          as that provided by vaccinations. It is also potentially effective against cancer stem cells. <br> <br>

          It is also well known that surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy also damage healthy cells in the body.
          This can sometimes lead to serious side effects. And immunotherapy has a specific effect, which means that
          only malignant cells are destroyed. As a result, it has almost no side effects. <br> <br>

          <b>What types of cancer?</b><br><br>

          In principle, immunotherapy is very effective in the treatment of all malignant tumors: the immune system can
          reach tumor cells in all tissues and organs. However, efficacy has not been studied equally well for all types
          of cancer. Until now, immunotherapy has mainly been evaluated scientifically for the treatment of cancer for
          which there are no sufficiently effective traditional treatments. For example, malignant melanoma and
          glioblastoma.<br>
          Various types of immunotherapy are undergoing international clinical trials. To test the effectiveness, it is
          common to compare the progression of the disease in two groups of patients: the group of participants who
          receive only conventional treatment, and the group that also receives immunotherapy. This means that
          participants in a (double-blind) study cannot be sure that they are indeed receiving immunotherapy.br>
          Appropriate studies do not exist for every disease and there are different exclusion criteria for
          participation. Find relevant studies on <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>.

            <h3>Immunotherapy with dendritic cells</h3>
            <p>The immune system helps people stay healthy by recognizing pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, as
              well as cancer cells, as harmful and killing them. It has been known for some time that the so-called
              antigen-presenting cells are necessary for the recognition of foreign bodies (antigens). These
              antigen-presenting cells inform the immune system of the invasion and activate other immune cells to fight
              it in a variety of ways.</p>

            <h3>Treatment process</h3>
            <p>
              Before starting therapy, an updated serology of infection for HIV, hepatitis B and C must be performed.
              Even if the infection status is known, we are obliged to retest it shortly before starting therapy in a
              certified laboratory, which has been reported to our regulatory authorities for reasons of product safety
              and occupational safety ...<br>

              After obtaining monocytes, they are cultured in the laboratory according to various protocols and
              differentiated into dendritic cells or tolerogenic or regenerating macrophages. Depending on the protocol,
              patients receive their "trained" cells back in 4-7 days.<br>

              Treatment is usually given as a baseline immunization three times, one day apart, for one week.<br> </p>

            <h3>Rehabilitation after cancer</h3>
            <p>Cancer rehabilitation is aimed at Patients who have completed primary cancer treatment and who wish to
              improve their physical and mental health.
              Each victim responds differently to the cancer problem and its treatment. Thus, in a holistic and
              interdisciplinary approach, treatment goals are jointly defined in order to gain new strength to return to
              professional and personal daily life. </p>
